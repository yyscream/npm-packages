- `/memory-summarize` — summarize recent daily memory into a concise context brief.
- `/memory-search-context` — search memory for topic-specific facts with sources and confidence.
- `/memory-prune` — review long-term memory for stale, duplicate, or low-signal entries.
- `/memory-rule-add` — draft a scoped rule note from a repeated preference or workflow.
- `/memory-session-save` — append a concise end-of-session note to daily memory.
