# @firstpick/pi-extension-todo-progress

Auto todo/progress tracking for multi-step Pi agent work.

![Todo progress widget](https://unpkg.com/@firstpick/pi-extension-todo-progress/images/todo_progress_v0.1.8.png)

## What it does

- Requires the agent to formulate a separate one-line `Goal: ...` before creating the first todo list or starting work.
- Instructs the agent to create concise, agent-authored todos for multi-step work.
- Instructs the agent to emit the current checklist before each execution step/tool call so the widget is updated ahead of the step.
- Tracks checklist markers from assistant messages instead of copying raw user prompt lines.
- Accepts markdown checklist lines exactly like `- [ ] item`, `- [-] item`, or `- [x] item`.
- Also accepts bare markers like `[ ] item` as a fallback for robustness.
- Strips matched checklist lines from assistant messages after mirroring them into the widget, keeping the widget as the canonical todo view.
- Injects the current goal/list back into model context before follow-up steps, so stripped lists are still available to the agent.
- Keeps a completed list visible long enough for the agent to check whether the goal is reached.
- If the goal is reached, the agent should produce final output; if not, it should create a new short checklist before continuing.
- Supports multiple todo lists during one agent run; each new list replaces the previous widget list.
- Keeps the latest list visible after an agent run and restores it on session reload/resume when possible.
- Shows up to 5 rows and supports manual scrolling/hiding.

## Install

```bash
pi install npm:@firstpick/pi-extension-todo-progress
```

## Configuration

No required configuration.

## Commands

- `/todo-progress-status` — show whether the widget is loaded, visible, and tracking a goal/list.

## Shortcuts

- `Ctrl+Alt+X` — hide current list.
- `Ctrl+Alt+J` / `Ctrl+Alt+K` — scroll todo list down/up.

## Tools

None.

## Example flow

```text
Goal: Update the README and verify the package still loads.
Todo 1/3 done, 1 partial
[x] Inspect package structure
[-] Update README behavior notes
[ ] Run focused checks
```

When all items are done, the widget title changes to a goal-check state:

```text
Goal: Update the README and verify the package still loads.
Todo 3/3 done · check goal
[x] Inspect package structure
[x] Update README behavior notes
[x] Run focused checks
```

At that point the agent should either produce the final answer or create the next short checklist if the goal is not yet reached.

The latest widget state is persisted in the Pi session, so it should survive terminal redraws, tab switches, reloads, and resumes until a new non-command prompt starts or `Ctrl+Alt+X` dismisses it.
