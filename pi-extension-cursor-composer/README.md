# Cursor Composer 2.5 Pi Extension

Delegates explicit tasks from Pi to Cursor SDK using `composer-2.5`.

It also registers a native Pi custom model provider:

```text
cursor-composer/composer-2.5
```

This provider wraps Cursor SDK local-agent runs, so it behaves more like a delegated agent than a raw chat-completions model. While Cursor is doing long internal tool runs, the provider emits periodic thinking/progress heartbeats so Pi Web UI does not look silent.

## Install

From npm after publish:

```bash
pi install npm:@firstpick/pi-extension-cursor-composer
```

For local development from this repository:

```bash
# Option A: install as a local package
pi install ./pi-extension-cursor-composer

# Option B: live-link all repo Pi packages for development
./dev/scripts/sync-pi-package-symlinks.sh
cd pi-extension-cursor-composer
npm install
```

The package depends on `@cursor/sdk`. Published/local `pi install` installs that dependency automatically; the repo symlink workflow needs the package-local `npm install` step because the sync script only creates symlinks. Then reload Pi with `/reload`.

## Configure auth

Set `CURSOR_API_KEY`, or run:

```text
/cursor-composer-setup
```

The setup command can save the key to Pi global `.env`, workspace `.env`, or only the current process. It then asks whether to add `cursor-composer/composer-2.5` to Pi's `enabledModels` scoped-model list in `~/.pi/agent/settings.json`.

If you already have a scoped model list, setup appends Composer 2.5. If you do not, adding it creates an explicit scoped list; use `/scoped-models` afterward if you want to include other models too.

## Commands

- `/cursor-composer-status` — check API key, SDK install status, native provider id, and scoped-model status.
- `/cursor-composer-add-scoped-model` — add `cursor-composer/composer-2.5` to Pi `enabledModels`.
- `/cursor-composer-models` — list Cursor models visible to the key and verify `composer-2.5`.
- `/cursor-composer [flags] <prompt>` — run Composer 2.5 on a prompt.

Flags:

- `--plan` / `--agent`
- `--thinking=low|medium|high`
- `--sandbox`
- `--no-auto-review`
- `--cwd=subdir` or `--workspace-subdir=subdir`

Example:

```text
/cursor-composer --plan --thinking=high Review this repo and propose the safest migration plan.
```

## Native Pi model

After setup and `/reload`, check:

```bash
CURSOR_API_KEY=crsr_... pi --list-models | grep cursor-composer
```

In Pi, it should appear as:

```text
cursor-composer/composer-2.5
```

Use `/model` to select it, or add it through setup/`/cursor-composer-add-scoped-model` for scoped Ctrl+P cycling. Changes to `enabledModels` are persisted, but the current session's scoped list may need `/scoped-models`, `/reload`, or a new session to refresh.

Provider usage/status behavior:

- The native provider forwards Cursor SDK `turn-ended` usage into Pi assistant-message usage, so `git-footer-status` can show input/output tokens, cache read/write tokens, cost, context, and speed.
- If the installed Cursor SDK does not emit final usage, the provider estimates input/output tokens from prompt/output text and records a `cursor-composer.usage_estimated` diagnostic; cache tokens are not estimated.
- Pricing defaults to Cursor's fast Composer 2.5 tier because Cursor documents Fast as the product default: `$3/M` input and `$15/M` output. Standard pricing is `$0.50/M` input and `$2.50/M` output.
- Set `CURSOR_COMPOSER_PRICE_TIER=standard` to use standard pricing, or override individual rates with `CURSOR_COMPOSER_INPUT_COST_PER_MILLION`, `CURSOR_COMPOSER_OUTPUT_COST_PER_MILLION`, `CURSOR_COMPOSER_CACHE_READ_COST_PER_MILLION`, and `CURSOR_COMPOSER_CACHE_WRITE_COST_PER_MILLION`.
- Cursor publishes input/output prices, not a separate cache discount; cache read/write rates default to the active input rate unless overridden.
- Default verbosity is `quiet`: show one short working line, final assistant text, requests, and errors.
- Set `CURSOR_COMPOSER_PROVIDER_VERBOSITY=normal` to include tool/status progress.
- Set `CURSOR_COMPOSER_PROVIDER_VERBOSITY=debug` to include rawer Cursor stream details.
- `CURSOR_COMPOSER_PROVIDER_HEARTBEAT_MS=15000` controls quiet heartbeat checks; only `normal`/`debug` show repeated heartbeat lines.
- Set `CURSOR_COMPOSER_PROVIDER_HEARTBEAT_MS=0` or `false` to disable heartbeats entirely.
- Set `CURSOR_COMPOSER_PROVIDER_AUTO_REVIEW=false` to disable Cursor local auto-review.
- Set `CURSOR_COMPOSER_PROVIDER_SANDBOX=true` to enable Cursor SDK sandboxing for native model runs.
- Large Pi `toolResult` messages are truncated by default before they are replayed into the native provider prompt. This keeps previous `read`/`bash` dumps from being resent to Cursor on every turn while preserving the message header, head/tail previews, original size, content hash, and instructions to re-read/rerun when exact omitted content is needed. Truncation uses Pi's normal tool-output byte and line limits.
- Set `CURSOR_COMPOSER_PROVIDER_TRUNCATE_TOOL_RESULTS=false` to restore the previous full tool-result replay behavior.


## Tool

The extension registers `cursor_composer_agent` for Pi to call when you explicitly ask to use Cursor/Composer.

By default, tool use requires interactive confirmation because Cursor SDK local mode can run commands and edit files. To allow unattended runs, set:

```bash
export CURSOR_COMPOSER_REQUIRE_CONFIRMATION=false
```

Use that only if you accept unattended Cursor SDK tool execution.
