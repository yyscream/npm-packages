# pi-extension-bang-command-autocomplete

Autocomplete for `!<command>` in Pi.

![Bang command autocomplete with common commands](images/Common_commands_v0.1.4.png)

Built-in suggestions for common shell commands appear as soon as you type `!`.

![Learned full-line and current-session suggestions](images/Learned_Lines_v0.1.4.png)

Learned full command lines and commands from the current session surface next to each other while you refine a bang.

## What it does

- Suggests command names while typing `!<command>`.
- Uses a built-in common-command index out of the box (with platform-aware defaults).
- Learns commands you run via `!`/`!!` and persists them across Pi sessions.
- Learns full bang command lines (e.g. `!git add .`) and suggests them directly.
- Learns flags used with those commands (e.g. `!rg -n`) and suggests them when you type `!<command> ` or `!<command> -...`.
- Also suggests learned command+flag combos directly while typing `!<command>`.
- Optionally adds commands from shell history for personalized suggestions.
- Keeps scope intentionally narrow (command + flag completion only; no positional-argument prediction).

## Install

pi install npm:@firstpick/pi-extension-bang-command-autocomplete
