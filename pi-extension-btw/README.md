# @firstpick/pi-extension-btw

Ephemeral `/btw` side questions for Pi.

## What it does

- Adds `/btw <question>` as a Pi extension command.
- Answers from the current session transcript without appending the question or answer to the main conversation.
- Does not expose tools to the side request.
- In the TUI, shows the answer in a centered overlay with scrolling and dismiss keys.
- In Pi Web UI RPC mode, starts the side request in the background and streams into a non-blocking live output widget.

## Install

```bash
pi install npm:@firstpick/pi-extension-btw
```

## Usage

```text
/btw what was the config file name again?
```

TUI keys while the overlay is open:

- `↑` / `↓` — scroll
- `PageUp` / `PageDown` — scroll faster
- `Home` / `End` — jump to top/bottom
- `Enter`, `Space`, `Esc`, `Ctrl+C` — close the overlay; if the side request is still running, it is aborted

## Web UI integration

When loaded inside `@firstpick/pi-package-webui`, `/btw` publishes structured updates through extension UI widgets using the `btw:output` and `btw:footer` widget keys. The Web UI renders the answer as a release-style live output card, so the composer remains usable while the side answer streams.

The Web UI card includes **Transfer Context**, which calls `/btw-transfer` to append the selected side question and answer as a displayed custom message in the main session. Transferred context is included in later main-chat model context. If the main agent is actively running, the transfer is delivered as live steering and injected after the next agent action.

## Notes

`/btw` makes a separate model request. It keeps the main transcript clean, but it is not free: provider token usage still applies. The request serializes the current branch transcript for context and appends the side question only to that ephemeral request.
