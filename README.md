# firstpick npm/bun packages

This repository contains my public JavaScript/TypeScript packages published via npm (using Bun and/or npm).

Right now it contains **Pi extension, skill, package, and theme bundle packages**.

## Skill authoring standards

- Follow the packaged portability guide in [`pi-package-skill-lifecycle/vendor/pi-skill-skill-creator/skills/skill-creator/references/SKILL-PORTABILITY.md`](pi-package-skill-lifecycle/vendor/pi-skill-skill-creator/skills/skill-creator/references/SKILL-PORTABILITY.md) when creating or updating reusable skills.
- Keep portable skill workflows harness-neutral; isolate Pi-only tools, slash commands, and local settings under a `## Pi adapter` section.
- Keep personal runtime memory outside package directories, e.g. `~/.pi/agent/memory/skills/<skill-name>.md` for Pi-local observations.

## Skill packages

These package active Pi skills that are not already bundled in an existing `pi-extension-*` package. Each package uses `pi.skills: ["./skills"]` and includes its full skill directory, including bundled scripts/references/assets.

Extension-bundled skills kept as direct Pi config includes instead of duplicate packages:

- `arch-linux-local` from `pi-extension-archwiki-local`
- `hyprland-local` from `pi-extension-hyprland-wiki-local`
- `nixos-local` from `pi-extension-nixos-wiki-local`

## Templates

Reusable scaffold for local documentation/wiki extensions analogous to the ArchWiki and Hyprland Wiki packages.

- local search/read/sections/extract/related tools
- setup/status commands
- packaged skill template for local-docs-first routing
- cache-backed Markdown/HTML corpus indexing

## Utility scripts

- `dev/scripts/install-pi-add.sh` – discovers local `pi-extension-*`, `pi-skill-*`, and `pi-package-*` packages and installs selected/all via `pi install npm:<package>` (supports interactive mode, `--all`, `--dry-run`, `--force`)
- `dev/scripts/check-publish-readiness.sh` – validates package metadata, extension entries, dry-run publish, registry/version status, and local-vs-npm packed contents
- `dev/scripts/publish-packages.sh` – plans/applies publish actions dynamically for all package folders or a `--targets-file` shortlist
- `dev/scripts/bump-package-versions.sh` – checks npm published versions first and enforces the next release version for changed packages (`+0.0.1`, rolling `*.9` to next minor `.0`; bumps up or reduces down only when needed); can write publish candidates to a target list
- `dev/scripts/release-workflow.sh` – orchestrates release checks: `--check` reports required bumps, `--plan` uses bump planning to shortlist packages before publish checks, and `--publish` applies required bumps before publishing
- `dev/scripts/sync-pi-package-symlinks.sh` – uses Pi's package resource resolver to symlink local development extensions, skills, prompts, and themes from top-level `pi-*` workspace packages into `~/.pi/agent/`; index-based extensions are linked as directories so relative imports keep working; renames non-symlink conflicts to `.hardcoded.<timestamp>.bak`
- `dev/scripts/validate-skill-routing-fixtures.mjs` – validates development-only `tests/routing/*.json`; schema-only by default, with optional `--settings` or `--skill-root` target coverage

## Publish model

- Registry: **npm**
- Client: **npm** by default; **bun** is the fallback publisher when available
- Installation for users remains standard npm registry usage, e.g.:

```bash
pi install npm:@firstpick/pi-extension-notes
```
