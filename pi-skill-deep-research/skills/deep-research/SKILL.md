# Deep Research

Deterministic research pipeline that produces reproducible, schema-validated
output. Same input + same state = same output.

## Triggers

Activate when the user asks for rigorous multi-source research or uses any of these commands:
- `/deep-research [topic]`
- `/deepresearch [topic]`
- `/dpr [topic]`
- `/dp [topic]`
- `/dr [topic]`

## Quick Start

```bash
S="{baseDir}/scripts"
B="{baseDir}"

# Full deterministic run (after claims + evidence are collected):
python3 $S/run_deep_research.py \
  --topic "Does caffeine improve focus?" \
  --topic-summary "Common belief that caffeine enhances concentration." \
  --claims-file /tmp/dr-claims.json \
  --evidence-file /tmp/dr-evidence.json \
  --policy $B/policy.json \
  --schema $B/output-schema.json \
  --state $B/state.json \
  --output-json /tmp/dr-output.json \
  --output-md /tmp/dr-output.md
```

Exit codes: `0` success, `1` validation/policy error, `2` partial retrieval, `3` no-evidence fallback.

## Workflow

### Phase 1: General Research (Agent-Driven)

Search the web to understand the topic. Identify up to **5** key claims to fact-check.

Write claims to a JSON file using this exact schema:

```json
[
  {
    "claim_text": "Caffeine (100-300mg) improves sustained attention",
    "evidence_required": "RCTs or meta-analyses on caffeine and attention",
    "confidence_target": 0.7
  }
]
```

Required fields per claim: `claim_text`, `evidence_required`, `confidence_target`.

### Phase 2: Scientific Fact-Check (Agent-Driven)

For each claim, search source databases **in tier order**:

| Tier | Sources | Flag |
|---|---|---|
| `peer_reviewed` | PubMed, Google Scholar | ✅ |
| `preprint` | arXiv, bioRxiv, medRxiv | 📝 |
| `community` | Reddit, StackExchange, forums | 🗨️ |
| `social` | X/Twitter | 🐦 |

**Evidence budget per claim:** 2 peer-reviewed + 1 fallback (max 5 total).

Write evidence to a JSON file:

```json
[
  {
    "claim_id": "C001",
    "sources": [
      {
        "title": "Effects of caffeine on cognitive performance",
        "authors": "Smith et al.",
        "year": 2020,
        "tier": "peer_reviewed",
        "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12345678",
        "citation": "Smith et al., \"Effects of caffeine on cognitive performance\", J. Neuroscience, 2020. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12345678",
        "supports_claim": true,
        "relevance_note": "RCT showing improved reaction time at 200mg dose",
        "retrieved_at": "2026-02-26T10:00:00+00:00"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

**Important:** Always trace secondary-source citations back to original papers.

### Phase 3: Deterministic Classification (Runner)

Run the deterministic runner. It applies these verdict rules from `policy.json`:

| Verdict | Rule |
|---|---|
| **Supported** | >= 2 peer-reviewed sources, agreement ratio >= 0.8 |
| **Partially Supported** | >= 1 peer-reviewed source, agreement ratio >= 0.5 |
| **Insufficient Evidence** | 0 peer-reviewed sources or no evidence at all |
| **Contradicted** | >= 1 contradicting source, agreement ratio < 0.3 |

Every verdict includes a `decision_trace` entry with `rule_id`, `inputs`, and `result`.

## Fallback Behaviors

All fallbacks are explicit and policy-defined. There is no implicit "best effort" path.

| Condition | Action | Verdict Cap |
|---|---|---|
| No peer-reviewed sources found | Descend to next tier in fallback order | `partially_supported` max |
| No sources found at all | Emit `insufficient_evidence` | `insufficient_evidence` |
| Source database unreachable | Mark partial, continue with available | Exit code 2 |
| Cannot extract claims from topic | Reject run, require explicit claims | Exit code 1 |

### Fallback Text Blocks (Verbatim)

**No peer-reviewed sources:**
```
No peer-reviewed papers found on this specific claim. Checking alternative sources.
```

**No sources at all:**
```
No evidence found across any source tier for this claim.
```

**Retrieval failure:**
```
One or more source databases were unreachable. Results may be incomplete.
```

**Claim extraction failure:**
```
Could not extract structured claims from the topic. Provide explicit claims.
```

## Output Contract

All outputs validate against `output-schema.json`. Required top-level fields:
`topic`, `run_id`, `policy_version`, `claims[]`, `verdict_summary`, `decision_trace[]`, `failures[]`.

Run IDs follow the pattern: `dr-YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ-<8-char topic hash>`.

### Deterministic Ordering

- Claims ordered by `claim_id` ascending (C001, C002, ...).
- Evidence per claim ordered by: tier (highest first) -> recency (newest first) -> URL lexical.
- Sections in fixed order: topic_summary, claims, evidence_matrix, verdict_summary, decision_trace, failures.

## Source Priority

1. **Highest:** Peer-reviewed journals (open access)
2. **Medium:** Preprints (arXiv, bioRxiv) — flag as "not peer-reviewed"
3. **Low:** Community discussions — flag as anecdotal
4. **Lowest:** Social media — flag as unverified

## Deduplication

Sources are deduped by composite key: `title_normalized + canonical_url_host + publication_year`.
URLs are normalized by stripping query parameters and fragments.
