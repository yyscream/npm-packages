# pi-package-learnings

Durable troubleshooting memory for Pi agents.

`pi-package-learnings` helps Pi remember **how a real problem was solved** without relying on chat history. After a troubleshooting session, you save a short Markdown note. The package then builds an index and summary so future agents can quickly find relevant past fixes, read the original note, and verify whether it still applies.

## What this package provides

This is a Pi package with four parts:

| Part | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Extension | Adds `/learnings-setup` plus LEARNINGS agent tools (`learnings_search`, `learnings_read`, `learnings_add`, `learnings_sync`). |
| Skill | Tells agents when and how to use LEARNINGS safely. |
| Prompt templates | Adds `/sum-LEARNINGS` and `/ret-LEARNINGS`. |
| Scripts | Generate the archive index, manifest, summary, and sync log. |

The package code is separate from the archive data. Your actual LEARNINGS notes live in a directory you choose, for example:

```text
/mnt/SSD_NVME/LEARNINGS
```

## Quick start

Install the published npm package:

```bash
pi install npm:pi-package-learnings
```

Reload or restart Pi if needed, then run:

```text
/learnings-setup
```

The setup wizard asks where the archive should live and whether to enable a daily sync timer.

For Firstpick's current machine, the intended setup is:

```text
/learnings-setup --dir /mnt/SSD_NVME/LEARNINGS --timer 20:00
```

## `/learnings-setup`

The setup command configures the full local LEARNINGS environment.

It opens one setup list. In that list:

- `Enter` / `Space` toggles rows or opens text input for editable path/time rows.
- `Ctrl+S` applies/saves the shown settings.
- `Escape`/`ctrl+c` cancels without applying.

When applied, it will:

1. Create the archive directory.
2. Create `archive/` and `logs/`.
3. Write the configured `learnings.env` file.
4. Create/update the configured stable symlink.
5. Install the archive scripts into the archive directory when enabled.
6. Generate the initial `manifest.json`, `INDEX.md`, and `LEARNINGS-SUMMARY.md` when enabled.
7. Optionally create and enable the user systemd timer.
8. Print a final health report.

Examples:

```text
/learnings-setup
/learnings-setup --dir /mnt/SSD_NVME/LEARNINGS --timer 20:00
/learnings-setup --dir ~/LEARNINGS --no-timer
/learnings-setup --check
```

### Health check

Use this to inspect the current setup without changing it:

```text
/learnings-setup --check
```

It reports whether the archive, symlink, env file, scripts, summary, manifest, and support directories exist.

## How Pi finds the archive

Agents and scripts resolve the LEARNINGS archive in this order:

1. Source `~/.pi/agent/learnings.env` and use `LEARNINGS_DIR`.
2. Fall back to the stable symlink `~/.pi/agent/LEARNINGS`.

A typical setup looks like this:

```text
~/.pi/agent/learnings.env       # contains LEARNINGS_DIR=/mnt/SSD_NVME/LEARNINGS
~/.pi/agent/LEARNINGS           # symlink to /mnt/SSD_NVME/LEARNINGS
/mnt/SSD_NVME/LEARNINGS         # actual archive data
```

This makes the setup portable: if the real disk path changes, update the env file and symlink instead of changing agent instructions everywhere.

## Archive layout

After setup, the archive contains files like:

```text
LEARNINGS/
├── README.md
├── INDEX.md
├── LEARNINGS-SUMMARY.md
├── manifest.json
├── archive/
├── logs/
│   └── latest.log
├── sync-learnings.py
├── summarize-learnings.py
├── run-sync-with-notification.sh
└── *.md                         # your troubleshooting notes
```

Important files:

| File | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `*.md` | Human-written solved troubleshooting notes. |
| `archive/` | Content-addressed copies of notes used by the summary/index. |
| `manifest.json` | Machine-readable list of indexed notes. |
| `INDEX.md` | Human-readable list of notes and archive references. |
| `LEARNINGS-SUMMARY.md` | First file agents read when searching past fixes. |
| `logs/latest.log` | Last sync run output. |

## Using LEARNINGS during troubleshooting

When an issue looks familiar, the agent should:

1. Read `LEARNINGS-SUMMARY.md`.
2. Find likely matching entries.
3. Read the referenced source or archive note.
4. Verify the lesson against the current system before acting.
5. Mention which LEARNINGS files influenced the answer.

The summary is only a routing file. The detailed note is the source of truth.

## Adding a new learning

Create a short Markdown file directly in the archive root, for example:

```text
/mnt/SSD_NVME/LEARNINGS/hyprsunset-warm-mode-keybind-resets-2026-05-19.md
```

Recommended note format:

```markdown
# hyprsunset-warm-mode-keybind-resets-2026-05-19

- Issue: Ctrl+Super+S briefly enabled Warm Mode, then it reset immediately.
- Tried: Inspected the Hyprland keybind and hyprsunset toggle script.
- Solution: Replaced two concatenated toggle implementations with one state-file based toggle.
- Verification: Pressing the keybind now switches reliably between 4000K and identity mode.
```

Then regenerate the summary:

```bash
~/.pi/agent/bin/learnings-summary
```

or use the prompt template:

```text
/sum-LEARNINGS
```

## Prompt templates

### `/sum-LEARNINGS`

Refreshes the archive:

- runs sync
- rebuilds `manifest.json`
- rebuilds `INDEX.md`
- rebuilds `LEARNINGS-SUMMARY.md`

### `/ret-LEARNINGS [issue/context]`

Retrieves relevant prior troubleshooting notes for a current issue.

Example:

```text
/ret-LEARNINGS NetworkManager DHCP got lease but no default route
```

## Command-line scripts

The package exposes these binaries:

```bash
pi-learnings-sync
pi-learnings-summary
```

Inside Pi's existing setup, these wrappers are also commonly available:

```bash
~/.pi/agent/bin/learnings-sync
~/.pi/agent/bin/learnings-summary
```

Direct script usage from the package directory:

```bash
LEARNINGS_DIR=/mnt/SSD_NVME/LEARNINGS ./scripts/sync-learnings.py
LEARNINGS_DIR=/mnt/SSD_NVME/LEARNINGS ./scripts/summarize-learnings.py
```

## Daily sync timer

If enabled, `/learnings-setup` writes a user systemd timer similar to:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Daily Pi LEARNINGS archive sync

[Timer]
OnCalendar=*-*-* 20:00:00
Persistent=true

[Install]
WantedBy=timers.target
```

Check timer status:

```bash
systemctl --user list-timers sync-learnings.timer --all --no-pager
```

## Safety and behavior notes

- Setup is designed to be idempotent: running it again should repair or refresh the setup.
- The archive directory is intentionally outside the package so package updates do not delete your notes.
- Past learnings are hints, not proof. Agents must verify current state before applying an old fix.
- Do not store secrets in LEARNINGS notes.
